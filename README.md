<h1>Internet shop</h1>

Internet shop, this is my own training project on java,
I used and experimented with maven, web server Tomcat 9.0.19, some interesting 
dependencies: log4j, junit, jstl, servlet, lombok, mysql and
checkstyle-plugin. In this program I connected to 
the database MySQL from jdbc. This program is not like anything else, it works quickly and I spent a 
very interesting time while writing it. I was obsessed with this project and tried to make it as good as possible.
